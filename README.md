# Translate

## Overview

Most document translation captures interpretative meaning rather than a word-for-word translation.

However, literal translation is syntactically illuminating. If we allow a reader to set a vocabulary level, then show words easier than this in the target language and harder than this in English, this allows a reader to read **at their level**. Imagine reading Les Mis fluidly in 20% French rather than entirely in French and looking up every other word. Once a reader is comfortable with a level, they can increase it.

An added benefit of word-for-word translation is that it preserves grammatical structure. The translation to English may look strange, for example "I have ten years", but this is valuable for understanding the language.

Files for translating and determining vocabulary level are deliberately omitted.

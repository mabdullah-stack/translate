# Translate

Most document translation to English captures the meaning of sentences rather than translates word-for-word.

However, translating word-for-word can be useful for learning a new language. If we allow a reader to set a vocabulary difficulty, we can show words easier than this in the target language and words harder than this in English. This allows a reader to read **at their level**, which removes the many pauses from looking up difficult words unuseful for their level. Once a reader is comfortable with a level, they can marginally increase it to add new words.

An added benefit of word-for-word translation is that it preserves grammatical structure. The translation to English may look strange, for example "I have ten years", but this is valuable for understanding the language.

# Translate

## Overview

Most document translation captures the meaning of sentences rather than translates word-for-word.

However, word-for-word translation can be useful for learning a new language. If we allow a reader to set a vocabulary level, then show words easier than this in the target language and harder than this in English, this allows a reader to read **at their level** rather than entirely in the target language, translating every other word. Once a reader is comfortable with a level, they can increase it.

An added benefit of word-for-word translation is that it preserves grammatical structure. The translation to English may look strange, for example "I have ten years", but this is valuable for understanding the language.

Files for translating and determining vocabulary level are deliberately omitted.
